### Important Notice 🚨

**Do not directly copy any of the materials provided in this repository.**

These documents are highly personalized and specific to my own academic and professional experiences. Copying them verbatim could be considered plagiarism and could harm your chances of admission. Instead, use these materials as references to understand the structure, tone, and content suitable for such documents.

### How to Use These Materials 📝

1. **Letters of Recommendation (LOR) Drafts:** Use these as a reference to see how a strong recommendation letter might be formatted and written. Tailor your own drafts to reflect your personal achievements and relationship with the recommender.

2. **Statement of Purpose (SOP) Drafts:** These drafts illustrate how to present your academic background, professional experiences, and future goals. Use them to get ideas on how to structure your SOP, but ensure your own statement is unique and personal. Also remember to tailor it to the specific requirements of the programs you are applying to.

3. **GRE Preparation Materials:** These materials include study guides, practice questions, and tips that helped me prepare for the GRE. Adapt these strategies to fit your own study habits and strengths.

4. **IELTS Preparation Materials:** Similar to the GRE materials, these resources include practice tests and preparation tips. Use them to guide your own study plan.

## Good luck with your applications! 🚀
